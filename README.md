# MTT
Source code for the multi-tokenization transformer based prediction tools
This repository contains the source code of the multi-tokenization transformer model (MTT) which was proposed as the encoder to obtain a high-quality representation of sequential data. The MTT is used to provide two machine learning-based predictive tools specifically designed for NPs that (a) predict the anti-inflammatory activity of NPs, and (b) predict the compound-target relationship for compounds and targets collected in the database but lacking existing relationship data.
